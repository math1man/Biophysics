After adding in Coulombic, ion-dipole, and dipole-dipole interactions,
I studied their effects, primarily the strongest ion-ion interaction.
Based on my calculations, the ion-ion interaction has approximately
the same energy as the hydrophobic effect. I hypothesized that given
enough ion-ion interactions, they would overcome the hydrophobic
effect.

Interaction energies (in eV/kT at T=310K)
Hydrophobic:
    H-H:    -1.16
    H-H2O:   1.16
Coulombic:
    +-+:     1.24
    +--:    -1.24
    ---:     1.24
Ion-Dipole:
    +-P:    -0.62
    --P:    -0.62
Dipole-Dipole:
    P-P:    -0.11

I first tested this hypothesis for the 24 amino acid long peptide
PPPPHHHHPPPPPPPPHHHHPPPP. This peptide folds into a neat little box
with all the hydrophobic residue on the inside under normal conditions:

(P)-(P)-(P) (P)-(P)-(P)
 |                   |
(P)-(H)-(H) (H)-(H)-(P)
         |   |
(P)-(H)-(H) (H)-(H)-(P)
 |                   |
(P)-(P)-(P)-(P)-(P)-(P)

Lattice energy: -4.97

To test the effects of the Coulombic interaction, I replaced all the
polar residues with alternating positive and negatively charged
residues: +-+-HHHH+-+-+-+-HHHH+-+-.  This yielded a very different
folding:

(+)-(-)-(+)-(-)-(H)-(H)
                     |
(-)-(+)-(-)-(+)-(H)-(H)
 |
(+)-(-)-(+)-(-)-(H)-(H)
                     |
(-)-(+)-(-)-(+)-(H)-(H)

Lattice energy: -9.0

Note that while it does still have some hydrophobic interactions, it
has allowed a large amount of unfavorable interactions between water
and the hydrophobic residue, because it can get so much out of the
Coulombic interactions.

Next I tried artificially lowering the energy of the Coulombic
interaction, because at some point the hydrophobic effect must again
become dominant. Cutting the Coulombic interaction energy in half
(reduced to +-0.62) yielded exactly that effect:

(-)-(+)-(-) (+)-(-)-(+)
 |                   |
(+)-(H)-(H) (H)-(H)-(-)
         |   |
(-)-(H)-(H) (H)-(H)-(+)
 |                   |
(+)-(-)-(+)-(-)-(+)-(-)

Lattice energy: -6.5

Interestingly, the point at which the two structures have equal energy
appears to be when the Coulombic interaction energy is exactly equal
to the hydrophobic effect. At this point, the algorithm even generates
a unique confirmation, with partially exposed hydrophobic residue:

(-) (+)-(-) (+)-(-)
 |       |   |   |
(+) (-)-(+) (-) (+)
 |   |       |   |
(-) (H)-(H) (+) (-)
 |       |   |   |
(+)-(H) (H)-(H) (+)
     |           |
    (H)-(H)-(H)-(-)

Lattice energy: -8.12

Despite the fact that the algorithm happens to generate this structure,
at equal interaction energies, all 3 of the above confirmations have
identical lattice energies.
